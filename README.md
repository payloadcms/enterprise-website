This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) that fetches data from [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com) using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

This repo is was made explicitly for an episode of [Learn With Jason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/) which includes a live, hands-on demo â€” follow along directly with [the episode here](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/build-a-scalable-design-system-for-enterprise-websites).

## Getting Started

### Payload CMS

First you'll need a running CMS. If you have not done so already, [clone the CMS repo](https://github.com/payloadcms/learn-with-jason-cms) and follow the setup instructions. Take note of your server URL, you'll need this in the next step.

### Next.js App

First, get your environment setup:

1. First copy the example `.env` file as your own:
   ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
   ```
1. Then open the `.env` file and paste your Payload server URL:
   ```bash
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying the documents within your CMS.
